### Studies on Quanta Emission Rates for Different Activities

1. **Buonanno et al. (2020)**  
   This study estimated quanta emission rates for various activities:
   - **Breathing at rest**: 10.5 quanta/hour  
   - **Speaking at rest**: 320 quanta/hour  
   - **Breathing during light exercise**: 33.9 quanta/hour  
   - **Speaking during light exercise**: 1,030 quanta/hour  

   These estimates are based on a viral load of \(10^8\) copies/mL in the mouth.

2. **REHVA COVID-19 Ventilation Calculator Documentation**  
   The document provides 66th percentile quanta emission rates for various activities:
   - **Resting, oral breathing**: 0.72 quanta/hour  
   - **Heavy activity, oral breathing**: 4.9 quanta/hour  
   - **Light activity, speaking**: 9.7 quanta/hour  
   - **Light activity, singing or loud speaking**: 62 quanta/hour

3. **Ventilation Rate and Room Size Effects on Infection Risk Study**  
   This study reports 90th percentile quanta emission rates:
   - **Resting, oral breathing**: 3.1 quanta/hour  
   - **Heavy activity, oral breathing**: 21 quanta/hour  
   - **Light activity, speaking**: 42 quanta/hour  
   - **Light activity, singing or loud speaking**: 270 quanta/hour
